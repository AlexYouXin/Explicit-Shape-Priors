# Explicit-Shape-Priors

This repo is the official implementation for: [Learning with Explicit Shape Priors for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17967)


# Dataset Link
[BraTS 2020: Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2020](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html)

# Preprocess
We follow the z-score normalization strategy in [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) to preprocess the BraTS 2020, VerSe'19 and ACDC dataset.

# Requirements
* python 3.7  
* pytorch 1.8.0  
* torchvision 0.9.0  
* simpleitk 2.0.2
* monai 0.9.0


# Training
If you want to train the model from scratch, run the training script as following.  
`python BraTS_train.py`  
`python VerSe_train.py`  
`python ACDC_train.py`


# Testing
If you want to test the model, run the testing script as following.  
`python BraTS_test.py`  
`python VerSe_test.py`  
`python ACDC_test.py`
